description: Show current status and pending thoughts
---

Display the current AGIT status including branch info, pending thoughts, and staged context.

## Usage

```bash
agit status
agit status -v
```

## Description

`agit status` shows:
1. **Current branch** - Git and AGIT branch names
2. **Staged context** - Thoughts frozen for next commit (after `agit add`)
3. **Pending thoughts** - New thoughts waiting to be staged
4. **Sync status** - Warning if Git and AGIT branches differ
5. **Git state warnings** - Merge/rebase in progress
6. **Conflict warnings** - External changes affecting your thoughts

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-v, --verbose` | Show additional details including latest neural commit hash |

## Examples

### Basic Status

```bash
agit status
```

Output:
```
On branch main

Staged context: 2 thought(s) ready for commit
  (use "agit commit" to create commit)

Pending thoughts: 1
  (will be included in next "agit add")
```

### Verbose Status

```bash
agit status -v
```

Output:
```
On branch main

Staged context: 2 thought(s) ready for commit
  (use "agit commit" to create commit)

Pending thoughts: 1
  (will be included in next "agit add")

Latest neural commit: a3f7b2c
```

### No Pending Thoughts

```bash
agit status
```

Output:
```
On branch main

No pending thoughts.
  (use "agit record" to add thoughts)
```

### Out of Sync Warning

If Git and AGIT branches differ:

```
On branch feature-x
  (AGIT branch: main - out of sync!)

Pending thoughts: 1
  (will be included in next "agit add")
```

## Git State Warnings

### Merge in Progress

When Git is in a merge state, AGIT enters read-only mode:

```bash
agit status
```

Output:
```
⚠️  Merge in progress. Agit is in read-only mode.
   Resolve conflicts and run 'git merge --continue' first.

On branch main
...
```

### Rebase in Progress

When Git is rebasing:

```
⚠️  Rebase in progress. Agit is in read-only mode.
   Resolve conflicts and run 'git rebase --continue' first.

On branch main
...
```

During these states, `agit record`, `agit add`, and `agit commit` are blocked. See [Git Resilience](/guides/git-resilience/) for details.

## Conflict Warnings

If external Git commits have modified files mentioned in your pending thoughts:

```bash
agit status
```

Output:
```
On branch main

⚠️  Context conflict detected:
   External commits touched files mentioned in your thoughts:
   - src/auth.rs

   Use 'agit commit --force' to proceed, or 'agit reset' to clear thoughts.

Pending thoughts: 1
  (will be included in next "agit add")
```

This protects against "hallucinated" context where your recorded reasoning no longer matches the code state.

## Workflow

```bash
# Check initial status
agit status

# Record some thoughts
agit record "Planning to fix auth bug"

# Check status - shows pending thoughts
agit status

# Stage files - freezes thoughts
agit add .

# Check status - shows staged context
agit status

# Commit
agit commit -m "Fix auth bug"

# Check status - clean state
agit status
```
