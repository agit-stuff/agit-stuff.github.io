## v1.1.1

**File Location Tracking**

Neural context entries now include file path and line number where thoughts originated:

```jsonl
{"role":"ai","category":"reasoning","content":"...","file":"/src/auth.rs","line":42}
```

This enables better traceability between reasoning and specific code locations.

## v1.1.0

**Git Workflow Resilience**

Major improvements to handle advanced Git workflows:

- **Merge/Rebase Guard** - Blocks mutating commands during merge or rebase to prevent graph corruption
- **Amend Detection** - Automatically detects `git commit --amend` and migrates neural memory to the new hash
- **Per-Branch Index Stashing** - Preserves pending thoughts when switching branches
- **Rewind Detection** - Handles `git reset --hard` by snapping to valid ancestor

See [Git Resilience](/guides/git-resilience/) for details.

**Semantic Conflict Detection**

Protects against "hallucinated" commits by detecting when external Git commits have modified files mentioned in pending thoughts:

- Detects "ghost commits" (external changes since last neural commit)
- Extracts file references from pending thoughts
- Blocks commit if files overlap
- Use `--force` to override

**Search Functionality**

Full-text search of reasoning history:

```bash
agit search query "authentication"
agit search rebuild
```

Features:
- Tantivy-based full-text indexing
- Auto-indexing on commit
- Incremental updates after pull
- Manual rebuild support

See [Search Command](/commands/search/) for details.

**File History MCP Tool**

New `agit_get_file_history` tool for retrieving neural commit history for specific files:

```json
{
  "name": "agit_get_file_history",
  "arguments": {
    "filepath": "src/auth.rs",
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

Enables AI auto-context injection before modifying files.
